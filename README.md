Public resources related to the [Open Know-How (OKH)][OKH] Standard
regarding a future Open Search Ecosystem for hardware ([NGI Search Project 2025]). 

For a detailed list of resources we are building this ecosystem on check out the [Repositories.md](Repositories.md) documentation. If you find something missing or want to suggest modules for this ecosystem to grow better please file an [Issue](https://github.com/OSEGermany/OpenSearchEcosystem/issues/new) or send your suggestions via [Merge Request](https://github.com/OSEGermany/OpenSearchEcosystem/compare).
